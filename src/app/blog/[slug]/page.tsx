        <p class="lead">Acing a technical interview requires more than just knowing how to code. It's a test of your problem-solving skills, communication, and ability to think under pressure. In this post, we'll break down the essential steps to help you prepare and shine in your next interview.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Preparation is Key</h2>
        <p>Start by reviewing the fundamentals of computer science: data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming). Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank are invaluable for practice. Don't just solve problemsâ€”understand the "why" behind the optimal solutions.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">During the Interview</h2>
        <p>When presented with a problem, don't rush to code. First, make sure you understand the question completely. Ask clarifying questions. Verbalize your thought process as you work towards a solution. Start with a brute-force approach if needed, and then discuss how you would optimize it. This demonstrates a structured approach to problem-solving.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">After the Interview</h2>
        <p>Always send a thank-you note within 24 hours. It's a small gesture that shows professionalism and your continued interest in the role. Reflect on the questions asked and the areas where you could improve for next time.</p>

        <p class="lead">Remote work is no longer a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach careers. For interns, this opens up a world of opportunities previously limited by geography. However, it also presents unique challenges.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Maximizing the Experience</h2>
        <p>To succeed in a remote internship, communication is paramount. Be proactive in reaching out to your mentor and teammates. Over-communicate your progress and don't be afraid to ask questions. Schedule virtual coffee chats to build relationships you'd otherwise form in an office.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Staying Engaged</h2>
        <p>It's easy to feel isolated when working remotely. Actively participate in all team meetings, engage in team communication channels, and take initiative on projects. A successful remote internship can be a powerful launchpad for a flexible and global career.</p>

        <p class="lead">Your portfolio is often the first impression you make on a potential employer. It's a visual resume that needs to be compelling, well-organized, and representative of your best work.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">What to Include</h2>
        <p>Select 3-5 of your strongest projects. For each project, don't just show the final result. Tell a story. Describe the problem, your process, the challenges you faced, and the solution you created. Include wireframes, user flows, and prototypes to showcase your thinking.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Design and Presentation</h2>
        <p>The design of your portfolio site itself is a project. It should be clean, easy to navigate, and mobile-friendly. Ensure your contact information is easy to find. A personal "About Me" section can also help recruiters get a sense of who you are beyond your work.</p>
